# qdb #

Quote Database Engine in Ruby / Sinatra.

## Running

**You need to have:** Postgres, Ruby ~1.9.1, `ruby-dev` (for a few modules) and
Bundler for the rubygem dependencies.

Before actually running the code, you should set up a few environment variables.
Check out the file `environment_variables` and assign values to everything.

If you're using Heroku, copy-paste the file `environment_variables` into `.env`
which will then let you run the app locally using `foreman start web`.

Alternatively, set the same environment variables in a manner of your choosing
and run `bundle exec rackup config.ru` or `ruby qdb.rb`, whichever one you like
more.


## Dev environment

Here's a quick dev environment: run `vagrant up`. It will setup an Ubuntu 14.04
VM with the required packages, tools as well as the Heroku Toolbelt installed.
