# qdb #

Quote Database Engine in Ruby / Sinatra.

## Running

**You need to have:** Postgres, Ruby ~1.9.1, `ruby-dev` (for a few modules) and
Bundler for the rubygem dependencies.

Before actually running the code, you should set up a few environment variables.
Check out the file `environment_variables` and assign values to everything.

Here's the long and *utterly* tedious process you need to pass to get this up
and running:

```ruby
bundle install
ruby qdb.rb
```


## Dev environment

Here's a quick dev environment: run `vagrant up`. Don't forget to set up the
environment variables first! The file will be copied onto `~/.bash_profile` on
the Vagrant VM.
